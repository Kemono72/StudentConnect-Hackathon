# 🎓 StudentConnect – Housing & Events Platform for Students

**StudentConnect** is a hackathon-built web app designed to connect university students with verified housing listings and student-hosted events. Our goal was to create a secure and student-exclusive platform for housing discovery, event coordination and campus community engagement.

## 💡 Problem Solved

Finding reliable housing as a student can be challenging and unsafe. Public platforms are often filled with scams, spam or listings not meant for students. StudentConnect solves this by using **university email verification**, offering access-controlled listings and a built-in **event board** to build community.
